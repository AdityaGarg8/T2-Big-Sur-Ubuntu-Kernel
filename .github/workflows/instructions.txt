Download the debs. Put them in a folder (say Downloads). Then run (assuming you have put them in Downloads, edit the path for another folder) :-

```plain
sudo apt install $HOME/Downloads/*REL*
```

Note:- The **linux-buildinfo**, **linux-cloud-tools** and **linux-tools** debs are optional. You may not download them if they aren't required by you. Rest debs are compulsory.
